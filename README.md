You want to create a personal record keeping system for first-person shooter games. Specifically, for each game it should record your KDA (kills, deaths, and assists) values; the number of times you’ve killed a character in the game, the number of times you’ve died, and the number of assists that you’ve made. You want to be able to look up this information for each game and also to update it as your stats change.
